seletion
to alter the normal sequence of execution
it is condition based.
condition checking constructs
**if
if (condition/s)
{
	true block;
}

when the speified condition/s evalates to true, then the statements written in the true bloack are executed.
if the condition/s evaluates to false, then if else part is present the statements in alse part are executed.
else part is optional.
when one if block follows another if block it is multiple condition checking.
when one if block is within another if block then nested condition checking takes place.
if  {} will not be written, then only one statement is coonsidered under the block

**if else
if (condition/s)
{
	true block;
}
else
{
	false block;
}


** if     else if

if(condition/s)
{


}
else if (condition/s)
{


}
else
{


}
** multiple if
if (condition/s)
{


}
if (condition/s)
{


}


** nested if

if (condition/s)
{

	if (condition/s)
	{
		
	}
	else
	{
	
	}
}
else
{

	if (condition/s)
	{
		
	}
	else
	{
	
	}
}

** switch case

switch (exp/var)
{
	case val1:statments;
	---	
	---
	break;
	case val2:statements;
	----
	---
	break;
	default :statements;
	---
	---
}

when the answer to a question has multiple answers from which the option is to be selected then switch case can be used
when the condition does not evaluate in true/false then switch case can be used.
switch case can be used with char,string and integral data types oly.
the case value that matches the var/exp will be executed till either break statement is encountered or end of switch case.
default is optional. if none of the case matches and default is written, then statements under deault part will get executed.
default can be written anywhere in the switch , it is a good practice to write it as last part of the switch.

**3rd concept iteration
execution of same set of statements at same place repeatedly.
looping construts
for , while, do while 
the loop iterations depends upon the looping condition

2 types => when no. of times the statements to be repeated is known use for loop
when how many times to repeate set of statements is not known use while loop, do while
do while loop executes once and then checks the condition that determines whether to continue execution of the loop or not.
while loop is called entry controlled loop as it checks the condition then then if the condition is satisfied it starts the iteration.

for loops are used when no. of times to repeat the statments is known
for(initial value;looping condition,increment/decrement)
{

}
 

while loop
while(condition/s)
{

	statement should be provided for termination of the loop



}

do while loop
do
{

statement which make the condition false after finite iterations


}while(condition);

break statement => when inside a loop break statement is encountered, then the loop execution will terminate and program execution continues after loop.
continue statement => when inside a loop continue statement is encountered,then statements after continue in the loop block are skipped and the execution starts with new iteration of the loop.

nested loops => a type of loop can be nested with any type of loop
for loops are closely associated with arrays and nested for loops with multi-dimensional arrays.
